Getting ready for #EarthHour2020 Very different than past but embracing all that it means. So loving having our daughter with us. Thinking about all those who are suffering during #Covid_19. So proud of our team @thekwcf who are tirelessly working to help. #StayAtHomeAndStaySafe https://t.co/U2lGxCUFK8
