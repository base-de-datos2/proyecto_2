@CPCDouches @bigbloke58 @JohnStossel @HouseDemocrats Heard on TV that FEMA/HHS sent 4400 ventilators to NY recently &amp; they're still in warehouses not in NYC hospitals. Do you think this is another PR snafu between Fed &amp; State? Or does NY/NYC Govt officials actually want more NYC ppl to die of #COVID19? MSM not reporting any of this
