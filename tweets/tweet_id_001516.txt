@VictorianCHO @annect64 You’ll be happy to know I stayed home. Green light for #Covid19 Qld Govt on “L” plates to fine me. I didn’t vote in Sat Council Election. Why would I risk catching #Covid19 up close &amp; personal with #ClimateChange deniers who’ll vote for GEORGE CHRISTENSEN’s Father. 🤢#StayAtHome
