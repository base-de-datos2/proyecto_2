I hate that many good people - community workers, #police, #FireFighters, #paramedics #doctors #nurses #HealthProfessionals - are distancing from their own families to protect them from #Covid_19.

At a time when they need family most.

Looking forward to future family reunions! https://t.co/6r6qs9r4GG
