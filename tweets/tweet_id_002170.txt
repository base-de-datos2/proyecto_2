@Jones79882692 @KrystaKeller @AmySchu70368276 @MeInTheMitten @GovWhitmer I take Hydroxychloroquine for systemic lupus. Currently I am unable to refill my meds because there aren't any pills left (Hoarding). For simple folks this medication is not proven for #COVID19 and it does cause blindness if at wrong dose or w/wrong meds.
