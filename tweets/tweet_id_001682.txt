1/ "keeps calm". This kind of framing that, IMvHO, is really damn dumb &amp; counterproductive at this time. #Sweden is undertaking almost no anti-#COVID19 measures at the moment. It has 3.447 cases now; in a week that will be *well* over 7,000. In 2 weeks, over 15,000. Bye, ICU's. https://t.co/Yed3dmy54w
