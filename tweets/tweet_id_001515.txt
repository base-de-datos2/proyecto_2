On Monday I will host a teletownhall to take questions related to the #COVID19 pandemic &amp; the economic impact. I'll be joined by Dr. John Scott of @UWMedicine, an expert in telehealth services &amp; infectious disease. Please join our conversation &amp; I look forward to taking your Qs. https://t.co/vXG1Gwfys7
