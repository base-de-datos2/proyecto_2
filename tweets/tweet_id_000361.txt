@AbbeyDowneyAuth That’s so disturbing! I am all for self-isolating/social distancing etc; as a high-risk person I’m disheartened by how cavalier folks in my town are being about the coronavirus.

But governments have been really draconian &amp; intrusive to the point of unconstitutionality. #Covid_19
