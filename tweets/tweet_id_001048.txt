@Abukarawale this a good news. I am glad to see that the toxic grass aka #Khat has been replaced by health and green grocers. One of the good things to have come out of the #COVID19 doom and gloom was our government’s ban on #Khat. Let’s #BanKhat for good: https://t.co/6lZNX0Mgph https://t.co/r1dBBu1YM3
