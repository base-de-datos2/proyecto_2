@steelewheelz @StephanieKelton Where or how can the US gov't collect more taxes? #cannabis is literally the only industry growing sales right now during #coronavirus to collect taxes for the gov't to pay for more jobs. The current print is already $6.2T: literally cannot just print our way out of this one.
